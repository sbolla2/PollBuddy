This is a detailed guide of contributions and learning experience thus far in RCOS.

LEARNING THE LANGUAGE EXPRESS

https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction

These two sites are mainly what I used to extensively research express. Routing is a fairly new concept for me and practicing express has
been opened me up to a lot of these concepts.

LEARNING THE LANGUAGE REACT

https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html

https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-react-handbook-b71c27b0a795/

These two sites are what I used to practice react. React seems more famililar and more intuitive to me than express does, because the syntax and concepts are closer
to languages like javascript. React has been my preference over Express and am beginning to start assigning myself to issues on the frontend side.


MY FIRST CONTRIBUTION: RESEARCHING AND WRITING UP noSQL ALTERNATIVES TO MONGODB

https://github.com/PollBuddy/PollBuddy/issues/476

This is my first issue and contribution to PollBuddy where I researched and wrote up a pros cons summary of 3 alternatives to mongoDB: rethinkDB, couchDB, and
arrangoDB. At this time we decided that mongoDB is to be the best option until it becomes an actual issue in its open source licensing policies, if it comes
to that issue we will shift to a tradition relational model (a SQL database).
